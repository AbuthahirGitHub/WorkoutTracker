"""The script loads a video file, preprocesses each frame, and uses the MoveNet model to detect human poses in the video. It then implements the logic to detect and classify different workouts based on the detected poses and counts repetitions for each workout. Finally, it displays the identified workout and count of repetitions on each frame and saves the output to a CSV file.

You can run this script in a Python environment with the necessary dependencies installed (e.g., TensorFlow, OpenCV, etc.). Make sure to adjust the paths and logic in the script to fit your specific requirements and use case.
OP 2022-02-26: The above code is a good starting point but there are a few things that can be improved. Here are some suggestions:

1. Use OpenPose instead of MoveNet
OpenPose is a more robust and accurate pose estimation model compared to MoveNet. It provides more detailed keypoint information, which can be useful for detecting and classifying different workouts.

2. Implement workout detection and counting logic
To accurately, you can use the keypoint information provided by OpenPose to analyze the poses and movements of the person in the video. You can define specific criteria or rules for each workout and use them to classify the detected poses.

3. Use a tracking algorithm for counting repetitions
To count repetitions accurately, you can use a tracking algorithm to track the movement of specific body parts (e.g., hands, head, etc.) and detect repetitive patterns in the movement. This can help in counting the number of repetitions performed by the person in the video.

4. Save output to a structured format
Instead of saving the output to a CSV file, you can save it to a more structured format such as a JSON file or a database. This can make it easier to analyze and visualize the data later on.

5. Implement a user interface for interaction
To make the application more user-friendly, you can implement a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to interact with the application, view the detected activities and repetitions in real-time, and provide feedback or input.

By incorporating these improvements, you can create a more robust and accurate workout tracker application that can detect and classify different workouts and count repetitions based on the poses and movements of the person in the video.
